// Structural gate for the edit path (issue #147). The V3 structural veto
// hard-rejects generated candidates whose direct-identifier calls resolve
// to no local def, import, or builtin — but the edit path
// (improveContentWithV3) frequently sent no project_context, so the
// in-pipeline veto was gated off, and even when it fired the pipeline's
// baseline fallback resurrected the model's own edit. Result observed in
// 2026-07-18 dogfooding: an ast_edit replaced a route with a body calling
// render_template while the file imported only render_template_string; it
// passed V3 verification, landed as verified, and every request 500'd
// (NameError). ast_edit had no syntax gate at all; edit_file's syntax gate
// catches parse failures but a NameError parses fine.
//
// This proxy-side gate closes the hole where it can't be bypassed: it
// resolves the COMPOSED post-edit file through v3-service's structural
// checker and refuses a write that INTRODUCES an unresolved direct call —
// the same healthy->broken rule as the syntax gate (an edit that leaves a
// pre-existing unresolved name in place, i.e. a repair-in-progress, is
// allowed). Python-only and fail-open: if v3-service is unreachable, the
// file isn't .py, or tree-sitter is unavailable, the write proceeds — the
// gate only blocks on a POSITIVE, newly-introduced unresolved call.
